Service Requirements
---------------------

A MicroService is required to provide the following resources to be considered stable:

* A minimum of setup instructions so that a developer can check the project out, get it running and run the tests
* Up-to-date documentation on REST API
* Unit test coverage > 80% 
* Integration tests against any other Services on which this service is dependent
* Default data that is generated on the staging version of the Service (for other services to integration test against). 
  * This should be documented
